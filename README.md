# Welcome to the Self Stream
This is my implementation of a personal video streaming service, in which one can manage their library of movies and series, and stream their content.
The project is heavily inspired by the jellyfin project (https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin), which I admire. But this is written in Go.
